Compared to other shooters like Halo or COD I feel like the trash talk etc is way milder in destiny actually. In PvE there's no \"losers\" per say, so it attracts more people who who like that more relaxed, everybody wins, attitude.  In any kind of competition you always have that 'fuck you, get rekt scrub, im better' thing going on. \n\nEven in real life sports if you want to compete at a high level you have to go in believing that you're going to win, that you're better than everyone.  It also means that you're going to use the best equipment or strats (e.g. blink, thorn, sunbreaker) in order to win. Even in high school basketball, our coach would always say 'when is something a foul? When the ref sees you and calls it'.  You play the game you have, if something is OP then it's bungie's fault, or if people are getting away with fouls then it's the ref's fault for not calling them. \n\nDoes it mean that you have to be a dick and toxic about it all the time? No of course not, but a lot of people are just assholes, and PvP + the internet gives them an avenue to vent their assholeness.

A lot of people criticize DayZ Standalone for focusing on the wrong things like making apples pickable from trees or farming mechanics instead of zombie pathing.\n\nBreaking Point goes in a different direction and adds a \"class system\" which basically gives you a role, for example Rangers lose \"class points\" if they kill innocent classes vs hunters who get class points for killing anyone.\n\nThe biggest problem in the original DayZ mod was the kill on sight mentality and it was difficult to tell what kind of person someone was just by looking at them, which is why the Breaking Point mod has specific skins for specific classes. DayZ standalone has clothing scattered around which allows more customization of how you look but keeps the problem of not knowing what kind of player someone is just by looking at them.","retrieved_on":1447322574,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"link_id":"t3_3qzws3","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwjy2oh","parent_id":"t1_cwjxhlq","subreddit_id":"t5_2sgp1"}

{"ups":1,"score":1,"author":"catastrophichysteria","edited":false,"created_utc":"1446336029","body":"It sounds like what you're looking for is an inpatient mental health program, which you'll likely need a referral from a psychiatrist or therapist to get into, rather than a psychiatric stay in a hospital.  Like I said, you need a referral most of the time for insurance to cover inpatient programs and you have to convince your insurance that it is necessary for your well-being (and even if you do most insurances don't cover more than a 30 day program) and if/when you find a program you have to hope that they have an opening for you, as well.  It would probably be better to have an open and honest discussion with your therapist regarding how your feeling about things right now and go from there.  Tell her why you think a mental hospital sounds like a good idea and see what she says and if she might have any resources to help you that don't involve being hospitalized.  I mean, you *could* go to a crisis center and get an evaluation and see what they recommend if you don't feel comfortable talking to your therapist, but then you run the risk of being admitted into a psychiatric unit in a regular hospital and believe me, you don't want that, they are the furthest thing from appealing.  Overall, I get the feeling that you're looking for support more than anything else, a place where you can feel accepted and not judged, and perhaps a reprieve from yourself.  Perhaps looking into group therapy options in your area would be better suited for you?  That way you can work on your struggles in a controlled and non-judgmental space with people who can relate to you while continuing to work and explore your new hobbies.

{"author_flair_css_class":null,"body":"I went on a date with a great girl from my university classes that I've known for a while on Thursday and we had a great time. The next day we both go to the same Halloween party that we've both been excited about for weeks. \n\nAll is going well, we find each other at various times throughout the night and exchange hugs, jokes etc. I finally ask her to come dance and she agrees, but at this point I notice she's clearly on something (e probably), and struggle to keep up and she basically sprints around the room. \n\nI end up taking a breather and talk to this chick standing at a nearby table which I guess triggers a jealousy reaction from the girl I like (100% unintended) and she basically immediately comes up to me and hugs me. Not long after we kiss for the first time, maybe 5 seconds. At this point I'm on top of the moon as she runs off and I attempt, again unsuccessfully, to keep up while she goes off like a frog in a sock. Again I get over it (it was actually was really annoying) and go back to talking to old bird standing at a nearby table. \n\nWe chat for a while as I wait for the girl I like to calm down and maybe come over and chill, or at least stop running around so I can dance with her, when suddenly mid conversation the girl I was talking to goes \"hey PATOMARK, your girlfriend is hooking up with another guy.\". I look over and sure enough the chick I literally went out with the day before, and who hooked up with me earlier in the night, was sucking face with some other dude. \n\nWell as you'd expect that pissed me right off. My friends saw the whole thing go down and asked me if I wanted to bail which I definitely did, and we went home. \n\nI got home and was (thanks to a combination of alcohol and having genuine feelings for this girl) extremely livid. I went upstairs, grabbed my headphones, went straight into my home gym with 2L of water, and banged out 5x5 body weight (+ a few extra kilos) squats (smashed my PB by about 7.5kgs). I've never anger lifted before, but by god was it satisfying. Being drunk had no impact on my form or power, I think the powerful emotions it heightened only gave me strength. \n\nI know this was less of a gym story, and more of a personal one, however I really needed to vent and get this shit off my chest. I don't care at all that she hooked up with another guy, that's her right considering its only one date we've been on. I just hated that it was after kissing me, and also where I'd obviously be able to see it (about 10m away from where I was). I also hate that it bothered me so much, but I did genuinely like her a lot. \n\ntl;dr - a girl I like kissed me at a party, then proceeded to kiss another dude basically in front of me causing me to go home and anger squat a big PB.

A reminder that strong bones are still possible, because it wasn\u2019t that long ago that I was in a little coffin across the country with weak bones and osteoperosis. I didn\u2019t have my own dooter, I had no spooky scary self-esteem. But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a skeltal. And another skeltal. And a few more skeltals. I found five skeltals. And they showed me what they did to become spooky and rich in calcium. Again, it\u2019s not just about the bones, it\u2019s about the good death; spookiness, doots, thanks and sweet calcium. And so I wrote a little epitaph, it\u2019s actually on my gravestone, you can read thesd directions here and it\u2019ll take you to my cemetary where I share three things that mr skeltal taught me. Three sp00ky things that you can implement today no matter where you are. Now, this isn\u2019t a \u201cget good bones quick\u201d scheme. You know, like they say, if things sound too dooty to be trooty, they are too good to be true. I\u2019m not promising you that tomorrow you\u2019re gonna be able to wake up with strong and beautiful bones. But what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know how to thank mr skeltal. So, I wrote a little message on my tombstone. Like I said, now it\u2019s not the most spooky, I just engraved it with a chisel, but it\u2019s real. Nobody can argue, this is my true story. And I\u2019m going to give you the three sp00kiest things you can do today. Invest in your bones. Always thank mr skeltal. Don\u2019t be a fuccboi. Okay, people see messages like this and they say \u201cAh that\u2019s not sp00ky that\u2019s for some other skelly.\u201d Don\u2019t listen, don\u2019t listen. Be a dooter. Like, mr skeltal, the skelly who started /r/ledootgeneration. He said that he was only 1300 years old when he read a scroll by Hades, and that book changed his bones. Books can change your bones. And in that scroll, Hades said \u201cthank\u201d so if you\u2019re a fuccboi, if you\u2019re not a real skelly you don\u2019t need to listen. Don\u2019t worry about it, I don\u2019t need to talk to every skelly. But if you\u2019re a skelly who knows that there\u2019s something spookier, cause good bones are possible, you know, for some of you listening it\u2019s not necessarily a new dooter, maybe it\u2019s more calcium, a new beginning, starting to build up your bones. Maybe it\u2019s a new death without so many spoops, traveling the underworld, thanking mr skeltal like you\u2019re destined to do. You can't do those unless you understand calcium. Calcium, I don\u2019t call it calcium anymore, I call it thank units. You must have enough thank units to grow strong bones and to doot your way to the top. So, I\u2019ll see you at my cemetary. So just follow this map to my mausoleum here, I\u2019m excited to share this sp00ky stuff. You\u2019ll see, not because of anything of me but because I\u2019ve been fortunate enough that mr skeltal is gracious with his calcium. I love to read scrolls but I also love real personal skelly friends. So let me share with you these three tips that have made my bones strong and rich in calcium. They\u2019re practical, you can do them today, you can start thanking today. All right? See you there. Thank mr skeltal.\n "}

{"controversiality":0,"subreddit":"NoFap","body":"**All Activities have a satiation point. Some activities have low satiation while others are high. Activities that have naturally high satiation normally is beneficial to you and will help you have a healthy mind, body, relationships, and further self actualization in your life. While on the other hand, activities with low satiation tends to trap you into a hedonistic treadmill.**\n\n------------------------------------------------\nFor this post, I'll separate the activities into **number1**- activities with low satiation, and **number2**- activities with high satiation.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Activities that have extremely low to near none existent satiation are:**\n\n* PMO\n* Junk food/fast food\n* Reading manga\n* Playing video games\n* Taking drugs\n* Watching movies, anime, romance shows, pornography.\n* There's nothing wrong with these activities inherently, but most people do not reach a satiation point of fulfillment and enter [behavioral traps where they enter a hedonistic tread mill of perpetual addiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Natural_and_artificial).\n\nWe tend to engage in these activities because of **two primary things**:\n\n1. They are [super normal stimuli](http://www.sparringmind.com/supernormal-stimuli/).\n2. They help us [**avoid pain** and **attain pleasure**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure_principle_\\(psychology\\)) at a very low barrier of entry. -Hot babes at a single mouse click away.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**2. Activities with a satiation point has an end, or at least gives you a sense of fulfillment, pleasure, and satisfaction that is lasting and will have little to no backlash ([PERMA activities](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/perma.htm)):**\n\n* Physical activities: good work out, biking, jog, run, walk, Bjj, tkd, basket ball, tennis, stretching, etc.\n* Social activities: good conversation, playing, flirting, physical contact, sensory engagement-smelling/seeing/feeling/hearing/tasting, wrestling, dancing, fighting, teaching, learning\n* Any PERMA activity that you're actually **FULLY PRESENT** and **ENGAGED** with:\n \n* Sensory pleasures: eating good food, consuming good art, listening to music, smelling pleasant smells, having pleasurable sensations of feeling textures\n\t\t\n* Achieving victory, goals, missions, purposes, learning new things, problem solving, creating, imagining, focusing, thinking, visualizing, planning,\n\t\t\n* One caveat: **ANY PERMA ACTIVITY THAT A PERSON ENGAGES WITH AND THEY DO NOT REACH A NATURAL SATIATION EFFECT SHOULD FALL UNDER SUPER NORMAL STIMULI** and doesn't have a natural satiation point at least for that person in that situation.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\t\t \n\t\t\t* Ex. I can eat without concern because my environment and thoughts is set up where I can naturally enjoy it without worry and hit satiation. Others have open access through their environment and their thoughts, routine, and drives lead them to have unhealthy mental patterns and behaviors where they don't reach a natural satiation point and continue without the appearance of any satiation because it relieves them of pain and gives them instantaneous short term gratification at a click of a button type patterns similar to PMO.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n**A good take away is to print a chart similar to this post that has two categories** (you can simply copy paste the activities here and add as you go along in life by asking yourself, \"does this activity have high or low satiation?\"). \n\n* One side will have **activities that have low satiation** and will be **YOUR personal list of things** that you know will throw you into the autopilot behavior trap response.\n* The other side will be a list of **activities that have high satiation** and will be **YOUR personal list of things** that you know logically will help you attain more pleasure and will **replace the PMO** type activities in your life.\n\n**Because at the end of the day, that's all our triple layered brains are trying to accomplish.

The narrative felt incomplete and never lives up to its potential, like a huge deviation from the story that should have happened, and perhaps was going to happen until some big redacted event that the devs probably aren't allowed to talk about occured halfway through development. \n\nI enjoyed a lot of things about Halo 5, but story wise it feels really weird, like a puzzle piece that doesn't fit into the space left by Halo 4 and Hunt the Truth: it doesn't flow on naturally from Halo 4 and it has no relevance to HTT S1 at all. It's like they conceived the main elements of the story in isolation from the rest of the established lore and background marketing material, then bent the lore around it to make it fit. \n\nI'll stop now before I get any more riled up. Best case scenario, I'd like to see Brian Reed and whoever else wrote the game interacting with the community to the same extent as Frankie and Bravo, answering our concerns and justifying their decisions.\n\nAlso, extra upvotes to you for being calm and measured about all this. I think your concerns are about as reasonably expressed as 343 could hope for. I wonder if they'd listen if they started getting a bunch of essays like this one in their emails? There's no way I could express the amount of questions I have in a tweet or two at Bravo.

I'll give you what I can off the top of my head. I hope it helps.\n\n* What are the benefits of hiring a technology professional who is a veteran?\n\nThere are numerous benefits to this.\n\nSimilar to having a college degree, successfully completing a military term demonstrates a certain level of competence and ability to see a lengthy, difficult task to completion. Also similar to a college degree, some level of competence can be expected from veterans, as it would be difficult to complete an enlistment term without gaining practical experience and knowledge.\n\nVeterans who worked in the IT sphere for the military have a very good idea of what a well organized, well maintained, well documented, and well secured network should look like. If ever your network is in need of review of any of these things, you could do far worse than to ask a veteran to audit it.\n\nIf your network demands high availability (up time), or is otherwise sensitive in a way that might make other administrators nervous, it won't phase a veteran at all. They'll be used to their networks being extremely sensitive, and also requiring high levels of availability.\n\n* What particular issues have you seen veterans struggling with?\n\nTransition into corporate \"chains of command\" seem to be a point of struggle. Some veterans seem to have a hard time figuring out exactly who they should be reporting problems to, when, why, and what the appropriate action is if they feel their concerns aren't being properly considered.\n\nAnother struggle is the VA, provided they need to make use of it. Appointments can be hard to get, and without an employer willing to work around the VA being... difficult, it can be near impossible to get an appointment with them at all.\n\n* What are common mistakes that veterans make when applying and interviewing for a position, or after being hired?\n\nI cannot recall any specific issues that I have seen. I imagine that it is difficult for veterans to negotiate salaries though, as they may have never needed to do so before.\n\nIt would probably be difficult to not appear to give an impression of being a very rigid person to an interviewer.\n\n* For those making, or who made the transition, what would be your top suggestions for getting and keeping a good IT position?\n\nThe main things are going to be learning how to market yourself, determine what salary you should be getting offered based on your experience, and how to find a GOOD company to work for. A bad company will take advantage of veterans, knowing they may not know better - this isn't unique to veterans of course, but that issue does include them.\n\n* If you're a veteran, what are things that you have struggled with in particular while making that transition?\n\nIt was a culture shock for me to be placed into situations where I wasn't speaking with a technical person at all. In the military, your supervisor is (usually) a person who had once done what you now do when they were your rank, and their supervisor has the same relationship to them.\n\nIn the civilian world however, it has been my experience that getting a supervisor that has any idea what the IT people working for them actually do is rare. I don't think I have ever been interviewed directly by a technical resource - although I have had them as a part of the interview.\n\nIt can be difficult to go from a rigid structure, on a very well regulated network, with a strong support structure, and bosses who know what you do to... well, none of that.","subreddit":"networking","controversiality":0}

They are *almost certainly* to be streaming in assets from disk anyway, so larger gaps between areas would have helped the consoles to load more into memory as the player approaches. I suspect the problem originated from either the X360 having very limited DVD space, or just because it was designed that way.\n\nFor reference, the PS2 had a *total* of 36Mb of memory and had games like the Ratchet and Clank series which had pretty hefty levels.","author_flair_css_class":null,"controversiality":0,"subreddit":"linux_gaming","ups":1,"author":"Half-Shot","score":1,"created_utc":"1446336082","edited":1446336550}

Also as mentioned above, content addition in Hearthstone mainly consists(and always will) of new cards. You have to encourage players to get these new cards for other reasons than completing their collection. At the moment this is done by making new cards more powerful than older ones, and we can see it's not very healthy approach for the game itself. I just don't understand why Wyrmrest Agent had to be 2/4, and not 2/3, why Shielded Minibot had to be 2/2 and not 2/1, why Mad Scientist had to be 2/2 and not 1/2, and I can go on all night. They would still be viable AND unique minions. \n\nI agree that bringing new mechanics to the game is a good thing and I know that it can sometimes bring unexpected balancing issues(patron,challenger), BUT since devs won't utilize the best advantage they have - changing card texts quite easily, I don't see a way out of this. What is the reason behind this anyway? Not confusing players too much with frequent changes? Well, majority of them (according to ''best x&lt;10%'' info at mid ranks) just won't give a fuck about some cards being changed. The rest of us who actually play the game more than two games a day, would be confused for like thirty seconds, until the changelog loads.\n\nThis isn't salt talking, I've reached legend two weeks ago and haven't played a game since, so my mind is clear.

{"body":"Hey, I share your concern. I've gone to work in shitty condition more often once I started homebrewing.\n\nOne fix I have found is to make low gravity beers. Best styles for me are 4% Saison with Brett, 3.7% English standard bitter. A session Helles using kolsch yeast was a good one too. These have a lot of yeast or malt derived flavor but pretty difficult to get drunk off of. Another idea is a 4% \"gose\" style using kettle souring kind of like Anderson Valley or Almanacs versions.. This is on the list.\n\nI love drinking beer but absolutely hate hangovers, and this is what I prefer to have in my keggerator. Its what I would prefer to drink commercially too but its harder to find on the tap list and at the bottle shop. I'm a little tired of session IPAs too.

This may not be a popular thing to say, but I don't give a shit about gun control. Not now. There are far more pressing issues to deal with. The same goes for issues like gay rights, and police brutality. These are important issues, all of them; but they aren't important right now. The media uses these issues as distractions from the most important issue of our time: Capitalism has failed. No one is allowed to say it, Bernie is certainly making progress in this regard, but it still remains taboo to criticize this failing economic system. Capitalism, in my view, plays arguably the most important role in creating or exacerbating most of these other issues. Black lives matter, for example, stems from the failure of our economic system to provide decent wages and comfortable lives for people living in destitute and crumbling neighborhoods (which, for historical reasons happen to consist of mostly minorities). When poverty goes up, crime does too. So what do we do?  Instead of fixing the flaws in our economic system, revitalizing and investing in these neighborhoods and making them nicer places to live, we simply treat impoverished neighborhoods like prison camps. We lock up people like animals and treat them like animals. It's because, frankly, we would rather treat people like animals than face reality. We have to stop getting lost in social issues. These issues matter, absolutely, but we have to start instituting practical changes in capitalism before we can bring an end to social injustice.

In fact, we never get out more energy than we put in to anything, but sometimes we can usefully convert one form of energy into another. \n\nImagine an engine running a generator. we put some sort of hydrogen-carbon compound into a reaction chamber, add oxygen, and give the mix some sort of 'kick' to spark a reaction where the carbons and hydrogens bond with the oxygens, and chemical energy is converted into heat, and eventually into electricity. \n\nFusion generators are like that in a way. You add fuel in the form of protons/neutrons/electrons, you give that fuel a kick(often with very high powered lasers) and let the fuel recombine in a way that releases a form of energy we can convert into electricity. \n\nSaying that you get out more power/energy than you put in is a shorthand that ignores the power/energy stored in your fuel input. \n\nIf it's JUST power you're interested, there are some ways to get put more power than you put using energy storage methods with different charge/discharge rates. An ideal battery might charge a capacitor for 1 second at 1 watt, for example, and the capacitor could discharge 10 watts for 1/10th of a second. It's 1 joule in, one joule out, but the capacitor discharges faster, so energy is conserved, but you technically get more power out than you put in.","subreddit":"science","controversiality":0,"author_flair_text":null,"link_id":"t3_3qzklr","retrieved_on":1447322592,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cwjx6t3","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","id":"cwjy438"}

{"author_flair_css_class":null,"body":"Yeah, there's no really perfect way, but there's an angle to consider here: you are still looking at having kids down the road but not right now. There's a really good argument that this may be a good time to use the benefits of the HDHP to save up for that potential medical cost.\n\nLet's say you take the HDHP/HSA and put 3500 into the HSA (difference in premium). You're going to need to use a fair amount of medical expenses to exhaust that HSA, and ideally, you will have a good amount left over. If you decide to have a kid next year, you could switch to the higher end plan (if it helps limit costs) and then use the money you saved in your HSA to help defray costs (you can't contribute without the HDHP but you do keep the money) and it's tax free to boot.\n\nMy general feeling is that if you're young and healthy without an ongoing or chronic issue, it makes a lot of sense to go for a HDHP with an HSA and put money into that HSA barring some sort of pre-planned cost. For instance, if I had a surgery planned for just after my election period began, I'd be ponying up for the better plan and enjoy the cheaper medical costs, likewise with a pregnancy. But until I get to that point, I'll take my shot with the lower premiums and savings.

If you building lean muscle you want carbs and lots of protein. You can ignore fat completely. And you won't have problems feeling satisfied on just carbs and protein because you should be eating 2500-3000 calories depending on how hard you're lifting. \n\nOr if you're dieting to lose fat and not working to build muscle at all you can ignore macros more. You don't need protein to build muscle and to a lesser degree also don't need carbs to satisfy your glucose needs to *allow* protein to become muscle. You could have an all fat and protein diet (like Keto) and feel really full and satisfied on 1500-1800 calories a day. Or a low fat diet. Or even a low-protein \"junk food\" diet as long as you stay low on calories. (It's just much harder to do that with junk food. Imagine eating a filling steak versus a bowl of potato chips.)\n\nI take a more rounded approach. Avoid stupid fats like butter for more filling fats like meats.

The other side note is that magicians do a trick where they play ~10 master chess players at the same time, and they win half the games.  They just remember what the master player's moves are, and then they copy them on a different table, so in reality the masters are playing against each other without knowing it.

For thousands of years religious people have forced their faith onto everybody else they come into contact with. There's some myth that, all of a suddenly they've stopped doing this. Sure they don't kill non believers anyone, that's great. That doesn't mean there's plenty of religion still being forced on us. In many places it's extremely taboo to confess disbelief. People get socially ostracized for expressing doubt. The reason it slightly \"more\" ok to be open about disbelief is because of all the push back required. The process in which agnosticism and atheism became normalized was through people saying \"this is fucking stupid wake up\". You have no idea of the fight it took to normalize this. Go to a small town in the Bible Belt and you'll understand how impossible it is not to be religious. Religious people opt for a middle ground now, so as to slow the death of their own religion.

You need a good grinder (Least expensive grinder that  will work for espresso is around 300 usd, which is the Baratza Preciso), and a good machine (Again, around $300 minimum. Gaggia Classic is a good starter machine.). And then you'll still need a tamper and some other miscellaneous stuff. \n\nMy advice, if your price range is that low, forget about espresso until you can really blow some money. You'll just be frustrated and put out sockwater.\n\nGet an Aeropress for about $30 and then save up for a Baratza Encore (Around $100). You can make something vaguely resembling an Americano. The mouthfeel  and flavor will be different, but it can make a good, strong cup of coffee.","author_flair_css_class":null,"edited":false,"created_utc":"1446336141","ups":-1,"score":-1,"author":"BurntPaper"}

Ok when it comes to communicating it's surprising how much we actually get from context and body language. You can make language learning part of the date and the confusion can be funny. Don't let the language barrier make you shy, don't hold back. Make sure you know the phrases for 'how do you say this in German?' and try and learn a few generics to make fun of yourself. You could also look up a few random words for irrelevant funny items and purposely mistakenly use those words when talking about something. Try and learn at least one compliment...talk is cheap in the same language but when you are crossing the language barrier and it's well placed it can be totally cute cause she will know that you took the time to rehearse that compliment. Hope that helps. And if she appears to be hot for you try and increase the physical contact as quickly as possible, hand to hand contact, hugs....snogging each others faces off doesn't require language...body language speaks for it's self lols","subreddit":"dating","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_3r0y6u","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1447322599,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"parent_id":"t3_3r0y6u","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhb1","id":"cwjy4ln"}

It creates a different sort of balance since melee is the strongest of the three with some of the best weapons and lots of spec weapons, but it is also harder to maintain. If you did want to be melee based, you'd pick attack or strength and just train the other back up if you die; most would probably go with strength and try to stay 7 levels over their main weapon (e.g. 67 atk, 77 atk, etc). Or you pick both and let your survivalability suffer for the stronger offence; if you had maxed attack and strength with lower hp and def that would still be very powerful.

{"controversiality":0,"subreddit":"lifeisstrange","body":"I agree with your initial points-- the story is structured very oddly, and the wrong things are given priority, and with Rachel Amber it seems to fall into the trap of letting characters be irrational so there can be a narrative to work with at all.\n\nThe supernatural bits... not so much.\n\n&gt;*This too is kind of circular. We're treated to a coming-of-age story about a teenage girl, and the device used to catalyze her maturation is time travel. Except at the end of the game, we're essentially told she was wrong to struggle to change things in her life and everyone would be better off if she had just sat down and done nothing (literally).*\n\nSee, this is why I find the \"Save Chloe\" ending to be fine; Max uses her time powers, realizes she made a mistake and that time travel is no good, and moves on. The town gets destroyed, but, well, she'll have to live with that. Max made her bed, now she needs to go the fuck to sleep.\n\nIt's not happy, but it's more satisfying than the save-bay approach of \"it was all a dream.\"\n\n&gt;*See what I'm getting at? The whole plot seems to come down to \"Stop struggling. Do nothing.\" It's really nihilistic when you break it down, and while some may enjoy that, I don't personally like spending hours and hours on a story, forming emotional attachments to the characters and getting invested in the events, only to be told it was all for naught.*\n\nBy the developer's own words, the apparent theme was \"acceptance\". While that is an important theme, surely, one can see how the overall scheme of the game inhibits this theme rather than embraces it.\n\nAfter all, the 'good' ending is you refusing to accept the mistakes you've made. The sentimentality of the final dilemma, I think, is what blinded people to the issue. And even *then*, the developers have said that the game was always going to end with town versus Chloe, always going to be about the relationship.\n\nA grand vision doesn't prepare you for the stones on the path, I suppose.","author_flair_css_class":null,"edited":1446337379,"created_utc":"1446336149","ups":9,"author":"TychoBrandt","score":9,"id":"cwjy4o5","subreddit_id":"t5_32tf7","parent_id":"t3_3r0yi0","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1447322600,"author_flair_text":null,"link_id":"t3_3r0yi0"}

So, how can he command them with something optional while they have not even fulfilled what is obligatory?\n\n&gt;If it is difficult for them to abandon sins, he should then strive to get them to love Allah by reminding them of His signs, blessings, kindness, perfection, and loftiness.

Write down this and any similar incidents where she's ignored your attempts at communication, steamrolled over your preferences, and then acted shocked when you declined to participate. Put them on your phone, so when you're suddenly yoinked off to a psych with no warning, you have all the details to hand. You can also politely request to talk to the psychologist without your mother in the room, and literally say nothing else whatsoever while she's still there - she can't control what you say.\n\nOnce you're 18, she doesn't have the legal authority to make you see a psychologist. You can politely decline, and if you let her force you to see one, you can tell them equally politely that you are a legal adult being forced there against your will and will be leaving now. (Which is always hilarious. Remain completely silent until any question directed at you is *not* verbally intercepted by your mother, then \"Hello, Doctor Smith.

{"controversiality":0,"subreddit":"AskReddit","body":"If you're into city builders, a game called \"Townsmen\" for Android (and possibly iOS, idk) is a great example. It looks like one of those classic Facebook games where you build buildings and then collect from them, build more, upgrade... except this is an offline game, there are no waiting times - I mean, you'll have to wait for citizens to do stuff, but the game doesn't run when you quit. It's like SimCity and other games in that respect, except of course, more simple. The game is actually free, but you have about 1/3 of the screen covered by ads at all time - for a dollar you can disable it, and it's worth it.\n\nIf you're into tower defense, I enjoyed the Kingdom Rush games, both the original and Frontiers. I believe there's a third now.\n\nPlants vs. Zombies is fun too - the second game is free with microtransactions, but personally I prefer the original, which costs a couple of dollars but has none of that nonsense. Plus the new one eats my battery *ridiculously* quickly.\n\nI also remember having a ton of fun with GeoDefense Swarm - another simplistic tower defense game. Interestingly, I think it's only available on Windows Phones. At least I cannot find it on the Play Store.\n\nIf you heard about the game \"2048\", you might want to check the original, called \"Threes\". It's much better, in my opinion. Done beautifully and actually is more challenging.","author_flair_css_class":null,"edited":false,"created_utc":"1446336190","ups":2,"score":2,"author":"Artess","id":"cwjy5bd","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","parent_id":"t3_3r0y00","distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1447322608,"link_id":"t3_3r0y00","author_flair_text":null}

By loading Great Forest before Enhanced Landscape and JK's underneath both the LOD problem with the trees went away immediately. I still haven't patched Great Forest to be compatible with Legendary Cities but I'll probably tackle that today or tomorrow, along with a patch to fix the trees around JK's Rorikstead (the patch on the mod page does nothing and the author has acknowledged that, no ETA on a fix).  \n  \nMy goal was to make the Skyrim landscape seem more dangerous and surprisingly the Dark Fantasy Overhaul portion of Enhanced Landscape did the opposite of that. The dead trees were a nice aesthetic but they're far too easy to see through, living trees make it much harder to detect enemies even at close range.  \n  \nI've added [Immersive Environments: The Marshlands](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30787/?) to my list, it's the only mod I've found that makes the marsh truly creepy to wander around. Loading that esp before Enhanced Landscapes has so far yielded good results but the tree LOD I get doesn't match, I'm hoping once I finish up my load order and throw in DynDoLOD that will be fixed.  \n  \nAnd in other news, HAPPY HALLOWEEN! NaNoWriMo 2015 starts tomorrow, and seeing as how that's probably going to eat up all of my gaming time I don't know why I'm messing around with load orders but, what the hell, it's fun.","author_flair_css_class":null,"edited":1446336481,"created_utc":"1446336193","ups":2,"author":"Dr-Dinosaur","score":2}

Aber ein Gl\u00fcckliches Leben der Allgemeinheit ist mir irgendwie wichtiger als noch ind en n\u00e4chsten 10 Jahren einen Menschen auf dem Mars zu bekommen. Ist wohl ne Weltanschauungssache.\n\nMeine Aufassung ist: Ein w\u00fcrdiges Leben (Unterkunft, kein Hunger leiden, Teilnahme am grundliegenden, sozialem Leben) zu erm\u00f6glichen ist Aufgabe der Gesellschaft (was wir mit Harz4 tun), ein gl\u00fcckliches Leben aber ist Aufgabe des Einzelnen. \n\n&gt; \u00dcber die Details muss man sich nat\u00fcrlich dann k\u00fcmmern. Ohne gr\u00f6\u00dfere Steuererh\u00f6hungen und niedrigeren Mindestlohn wird das nicht gehen.\n\nUnd genau darin sehe ich das Problem. Wenn wir denen, die arbeiten, mehr Steuern aufb\u00fcrgen damit andere nicht einen Job machen m\u00fcssen, der ihnen nicht gef\u00e4llt, kann man kaum noch von Gerechtigkeit oder sozialem Verhalten sprechen. Und k\u00f6nnen wir das nicht, nehmen wir dem BGE seine Daseinsberchtigung. Denn, wenn nicht mit Gerechtigkeit oder sozialem Verhalten, wie sonst wollen wir ein BGE rechtfertigen?\n\n&gt; Ich glaube, das Stigma eines Friseurs der 10 Stunden die Woche arbeitet ist um einiges kleiner als das eines Harz4 Empf\u00e4ngers. Nur kann es im heutigen System keine 10 Stunden Friseure geben, was ich f\u00fcr einen gro\u00dfe Fehler halte.\n\nAuch mit BGE wird es den 10h Friseur nicht geben, zumindest nicht als \"Hauptberuf\". Ohne Mindestlohn und mit BGE sinkt die Bezahlung f\u00fcr T\u00e4tigkeiten wie die eines Friseurs, Lagerarbeiters, Kassierers oder Briefzustellers schnell auf 2 Euro die Stunde.

There are ads posting deals for sale, private lenders, and wants for both.  You'll probably want to spend a little time on the site first, get to know who the reputable people are.  Who takes time out of their day to give out advice?  Who has projects you can look at online -- pictures, video, detailed information on what they've done?  Who has the experience to take on projects such as flipping or buy and hold where you need capital like that?  If someone has a good track record, they'll have the experience you can see for yourself.  You can also search the site as there are many people like yourself who have already been a part of the site and asked the same question \"How can I become a private lender?\"  Those are the threads you want to read.  If nothing else, you'll learn a ton."}

We also are really suspicious of the CCP because it has a long record of being ultra-scummy without any means of accountability. America is upholding an international law that China is breaking, namely that it can't just go building fake islands to claim the water around it. Literally nobody else of consequence is on China's side on this, so they're asking us to restrain China and uphold international law.\n\nIs this America controlling the world? Sort of. America maintains hegemony through perceived freedom through free trade and a huge amount of cultural charisma. Keep in mind, Southeast Asian countries **want** America's help, and the fact that China overplays its cards by thinking it can just build islands without retaliation. Worse, they make threats that they won't back up, and end up looking like a big, petulant crybaby, like North Korea. This whole debacle is just clear proof that China is neither developed enough to act as a world leader yet, nor is its leadership intelligent enough to understand that the rest of the world aren't fooled or bullied by the CCP as their own people are by them.\n\nTo conclude, no. We don't want war.

If you read all her posts and kind of read between the lines there's a lot there.  For example the abuse of the two year old child started when the husband was 13.  Thirteen is old enough to know better than to beat a two year old.  Some 13 year olds have been tried as adults for crimes they commit.  It's not like he was five when he was forced to beat a child.\n\nAlso, at 29 he's still so dense that he told her J doesn't need an apology from him, but just needs to \"forget about the abuse.\"  Then he defends the mom when she emotionally abuses J at their house, and stands up for the abuser when the OP defends the victim.  Then he tells her to mind her own business when she speaks to him privately about her objections to his mom being abusive to J.  Then he lies to her about knowing that J was kicked out of the mom's house and was practically homeless.  Then he blames J for the divorce, then he threatens to turn his back on her and their kids forever when she files (which would be great if he did by the way).\n\nJust reading between the lines here, but I would bet a lot of money that OP's soon to be ex does not think he needs counseling, doesn't want any, and doesn't think the abuse is that big a deal.  \n\nIf she ignores all of that, and I'm sure there's more that the OP didn't include so as to not write a whole novel, then she would be really dumb to stick around with that guy.  It's like he's willfully dense.  Yeah he needs counseling, but he doesn't want it.  What can OP do if her husband doesn't think he needs help, nor does he want any.  All she can do is what's best for her children, divorce the man.

If you queue as a group, you gain \"bonus\" MMR in proportion to how many people you have in your group.\n\nSo like let's say for instance your individual MMR is 2000. If you queue with 1 other person (let's say their MMR is 2000 to keep it simple), your average MMR is still 2000, but the \"bonus\" MMR bumps you up to 2100, so you'd be matched with and against 2100 rated people. They can be a bunch of 2100 rated Solo Q'ers, or they can also have a 2000 MMR duo that got bumped up, whatever. If you have 3 people in the group (again, assuming the average MMR is 2000 still), it goes up to 2200, etc.\n\nThere are definitely lots of problems to be worked out, like how much each group member will contribute to \"bonus MMR\", how would it interact with multiple groups (say 2+2+1 or 3+2), etc. It's just a very rough idea I had.\n\nSo with OP's match, the new guys don't have any MMRs posted on hotdogs presumably 'cause they don't have enough games. Let's just say that their MMR is, I dunno, 1500. If they grouped as a 4-stack, their MMR would get bumped up to ~1850 or so. As a result, they could still go against solo Q'ers that are more skilled than they are, but they have the potential to be more coordinated because they queued as a group. Alternatively, they can also go against a 1500 rated 4-stack, or maybe two 1650 rated duos with 1 solo, etc. I think it would be a lot more flexible than the current system.","author_flair_css_class":"sylvannas"}

For example, a professor teaching quantum theory or general relativity cannot whip out giant pendulums to enthrall a class for 15 minutes. It's just not the nature of the subject, nor would it be worth the time: there's too much to cover. Even for intro or \"poet\" audiences, some demonstrations while entertaining are really just illustrating something that's obvious to many students so in some sense it really is dumbing down university to appeal the masses, which is what his famous pendulum demonstration is.

Let's look at the abstract of the study. He took 30 people which already is far too small of a sample size to draw conclusions in a study of this nature. ALL 30 people thought they were gluten insensitive and all 30 were tested and were negative for celiacs disease. The study then showed that ALL 30 PEOPLE GOT SICK FROM WHAT THEY ATE. That included the people who ate the gluten free diet, it included the people on all the other diets. \n\nSo what this studied concluded is that people who had undiagnosed digestive symptoms all suffered from digestive symptoms. What this DOES NOT SHOW is that gluten sensitivity is not a thing. It shows that maybe these people who thought they were gluten sensitive were experiencing some other form of digestive distress. But they got sick from eating the gluten too. So for all we know some of them were actually sensitive to the gluten. The study is flawed in it's design.\n\nNow secondly there was another study that came out this yearA FULL YEAR after this over one year old study that showed that GLUTEN SENSITIVITY IS IN FACT a thing.\n\nTo sum up please learn how to use your brains and think critically instead of reading a title and using it to confirm your biases. And the end of the day there are millions of people who are suffering from digestive symptoms they are trying to fix.

{"body":"&gt; No, no no. No.\n&gt; They have to have those permissions to literally do anything with your pictures. The right to make copies? Every image on a phone that isn't the one you took the picture on is a \"copy\". A digital copy, sure, but it's still a copy. If no one is allowed to make copies of your picture, the only way you can show it to people is to physically show it on your device. By definition, SnapChat must \"copy\" your picture to share it with your friends.\n&gt; Likewise, \"distribution\" means \"giving other people your picture\", or, you know, exactly what you're asking SnapChat to do. You want your friends to see your picture, so you give SnapChat permission to share it, so you don't have to do what I said earlier and physically show them your own device's screen every time.\n&gt; Saving and using is part of the same process. Your data has to go to a server before being distributed to your contacts. That means it's \"saved\" on a device somewhere. Without that permission, your picture has to go directly from your device to your friends' devices, which...isn't how the internet works, for starters. But if one channel is down for even a minute, SnapChat has to store your image until that channel opens back up and they can send your picture out. So without that, it would be almost impossible technologically to share your pictures.\n&gt; \"Public display\" is to cover them if three people turn and look at one friend's screen. That's considered to be \"public viewing\" and without that permission, you could sue them if anyone other than the ONE SINGLE PERSON so much as glanced at the screen while your picture was up, so they couldn't ever send pictures out of fear that, oh no, someone looked at the screen.\n&gt; The reason it's hard to understand is that it all has to be in archaic legalese because our copyright laws are laughably obsolete. Copyright law was designed in an era when \"sharing\" an image meant you had to physically print a copy (or even paint a copy by hand) for every person or group you wanted to share it with and hand those copies to them. Technology as made that much easier, but it's also blurred what it means to \"copy\" and \"distribute\". Our laws have not kept up with that technology, so SnapChat (and Facebook and Instagram and etc.) all have the same basic \"WE CAN DO WHATEVER THE FUCK WE WANT WITH YOUR STUFF\" privacy policies so they're covered in case some court or judge decides that what they have to do to share your stuff with the people you want it shared with violates some copyright law clause, they can say they had permission from you to do it.\n&gt; If you actually read through the privacy policies, especially the PR parts that aren't in legalese, they almost always say, \"Look, we're not actually going to steal your stuff, you still have all the rights and control over your stuff, we don't want your stuff, we just need your permission so we can do our jobs.\"\n\n-RhynoD \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3r00ek/eli5_snapchat_has_now_reserved_the_right_to_save/\n","author_flair_css_class":"flair-default","controversiality":0,"subreddit":"jailbreak","ups":75,"author":"Spyruf","score":75,"edited":false,"created_utc":"1446336224","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8c5","parent_id":"t3_3r0edr","id":"cwjy5wp","link_id":"t3_3r0edr","author_flair_text":"iPhone 6, iOS 9.0.2","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1447322616}
